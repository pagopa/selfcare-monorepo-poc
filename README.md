# SelfCare Monorepo PoC - Nx Release + Version Plans

This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating a monorepo setup using **Nx** with **Version Plans** (similar to Changesets) for automated versioning and deployment.

## 🎯 PoC Objectives

- ✅ **Automated Versioning**: Test Nx Release with Version Plans
- ✅ **PR-Based Workflow**: Automatic PR creation/update for releases
- ✅ **Multi-Environment**: DEV/UAT/PROD deployment based on versions
- ✅ **Selective Deployment**: Only deploy affected projects
- ✅ **RC + Stable**: Support both pre-release (RC) and stable versions

### Key Concepts

- **Version Plans**: Markdown files in `.nx/version-plans/` that declare intended changes
- **Nx Release**: Command that reads version plans, bumps versions, generates CHANGELOGs, and commits
- **Automatic PR**: GitHub Action creates/updates "Version Packages" PR when version plans are pushed
- **Environment Detection**: RC versions (e.g., `1.1.0-rc.0`) → UAT, Stable versions (e.g., `1.1.0`) → PROD
- **Selective Deployment**: Only projects with version changes are deployed

## 🔄 How Version Plans Work

### Step-by-Step Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer makes changes] --> B[Create Version Plan]
    B --> C[npx nx release plan]
    C --> D[Select projects & bump type]
    D --> E[Plan saved in .nx/version-plans/]
    E --> F[Commit & Push to main]
    F --> G[version-packages.yml triggers]
    G --> H[npx nx release --skip-publish]
    H --> I[Update package.json + CHANGELOG]
    I --> J[Create/Update Version Packages PR]
    J --> K{Team Reviews PR}
    K -->|Approve & Merge| L[release.yml triggers]
    L --> M[Create Git Tags]
    M --> N{Detect Version Type}
    N -->|Contains -rc.| O[Deploy to UAT]
    N -->|Stable| P[Deploy to PROD]
```

### Version Plan Creation

When a developer finishes work on a feature/fix:

```bash
# Interactive prompt to create version plan
npx nx release plan

# Example prompts:
# - Which projects to version? → onboarding-ms, product-ms
# - What bump type? → minor (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
# - Message? → "Add user authentication flow"
```

This creates a file like `.nx/version-plans/auth-feature-20241215.md`:

```markdown
---
onboarding-ms: minor
product-ms: minor
---

Add user authentication flow with JWT tokens and refresh mechanism
```

### Automated Processing

1. **Developer pushes** version plan to `main`
2. **GitHub Action detects** `.nx/version-plans/**` changes
3. **Nx Release runs**: `npx nx release --skip-publish`
   - Reads all `.md` files in `.nx/version-plans/`
   - Calculates new versions for each project
   - Updates `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Deletes processed version plan files
   - Creates a git commit
4. **GitHub Action creates/updates PR** titled "chore: Release (Version Packages) 🦋"
5. **Team reviews** the aggregated changes
6. **On merge**, tags are created and deployment workflows trigger

---

## 🤖 Workflow Automation

### 1. `deploy-dev.yml` - Continuous DEV Deployment

**Trigger**: Every push to `main` (except version plans and CHANGELOGs)

**Purpose**: Continuous deployment to DEV environment

**Logic**:
- Detects affected projects via file changes
- Deploys only changed microservices/infrastructure
- Runs independently from release workflow

**Example**:
```
Push: apps/onboarding-ms/src/controller.ts
→ Deploys onboarding-ms to DEV (not product-ms or iam-ms)
```

---

### 2. `version-packages.yml` - PR Automation

**Trigger**: Push to `main` with changes in `.nx/version-plans/**`

**Purpose**: Automatically create/update "Version Packages" PR

**Logic**:
1. Check if version plan files exist
2. Run `npx nx release --skip-publish` to:
   - Bump versions in `package.json`
   - Generate/update `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Delete processed `.md` files
   - Create commit with changes
3. Check if "Version Packages" PR exists
4. Create new PR or update existing one
5. Add summary of changes to PR body

**PR Body Example**:
```markdown
## 📦 Version Changes

This PR was automatically generated by the Version Packages workflow.

### Changed Projects:
- **onboarding-ms**: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
- **product-ms**: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1

### Changesets Applied:
- Add authentication flow (`auth-feature-20241215.md`)
- Fix database connection pool (`bugfix-db-20241215.md`)

Once merged, tags will be created and deployment workflows will trigger.
```

---

### 3. `release.yml` - Post-Merge Deployment

**Trigger**: Push to `main` with changes in `**/package.json` or `**/CHANGELOG.md`

**Purpose**: Create tags and deploy to UAT or PROD

**Logic**:
1. **Detect Release Commit**: Check if commit message matches release pattern
2. **Extract Changed Projects**: Parse `package.json` files with version changes
3. **Create Git Tags**: Tag each project (e.g., `onboarding-ms-v1.1.0`)
4. **Determine Environment**:
   - If version contains `-rc.` → Deploy to **UAT**
   - Otherwise → Deploy to **PROD**
5. **Create GitHub Release**: With changelog and prerelease flag for RC

**Environment Detection Examples**:
```bash
# RC version → UAT
"version": "1.1.0-rc.0"  → Deploys to UAT

# Stable version → PROD
"version": "1.1.0"       → Deploys to PROD
```

ls .nx/version-plans/
# → new-feature-<timestamp>.md

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add authentication to onboarding-ms"
git push origin main

# 5. Watch GitHub Actions create the PR
# → Go to GitHub and see "chore: Release (Version Packages) 🦋" PR
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Stable Release

**Goal**: Test single project minor bump to PROD

```bash
# 1. Create version plan
npx nx release plan
# Select: onboarding-ms
# Bump: minor
# Message: "Add health check endpoint"

# 2. Push and trigger PR creation
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add health check"
git push origin main

# 3. Review PR
# → Check package.json shows 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
# → Check CHANGELOG.md updated
# → Check version plan deleted

# 4. Merge PR
# → release.yml creates tag: onboarding-ms-v1.1.0
# → Deploys to PROD (no -rc in version)
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Version Packages PR created automatically
- ✅ `onboarding-ms/package.json`: `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`
- ✅ `onboarding-ms/CHANGELOG.md` updated
- ✅ Git tag `onboarding-ms-v1.1.0` created
- ✅ Deployed to PROD environment

---

### Scenario 2: RC Release for UAT

**Goal**: Test pre-release version for UAT testing

```bash
# 1. Create version plan with preminor
npx nx release plan
# Select: product-ms
# Bump: preminor
# Message: "Test new payment integration"

# 2. Push changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add payment integration (RC)"
git push origin main

# 3. Merge generated PR
# → Version becomes 1.1.0-rc.0
# → release.yml detects -rc.0
# → Deploys to UAT (not PROD)

# 4. After UAT approval, create stable release
npx nx release plan
# Select: product-ms
# Bump: patch (to remove -rc and stabilize)
# Message: "Stabilize payment integration"

# Push → Merge PR → Deploys to PROD as 1.1.0
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ First merge: `product-ms` → `1.1.0-rc.0` → UAT
- ✅ Second merge: `product-ms` → `1.1.0` → PROD
- ✅ GitHub Release marked as pre-release for RC

---

### Scenario 3: Multiple Projects in Single Plan

**Goal**: Version multiple projects together

```bash
# 1. Make changes to multiple microservices
echo "// Shared update" >> apps/onboarding-ms/src/index.ts
echo "// Shared update" >> apps/iam-ms/src/index.ts

# 2. Create single version plan for both
npx nx release plan
# Select: onboarding-ms, iam-ms
# Bump: patch
# Message: "Update shared authentication library"

# 3. Push and merge
git add .
git commit -m "fix: update auth library across services"
git push origin main

# → Single PR updates both projects
# → Both get v1.0.1
# → Both deployed together
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Single PR updates multiple `package.json` files
- ✅ Both projects get same version bump
- ✅ Combined CHANGELOG entry
- ✅ Two tags created: `onboarding-ms-v1.0.1`, `iam-ms-v1.0.1`

---

### Scenario 4: Accumulating Changes

**Goal**: Multiple version plans before release

```bash
# Developer A
npx nx release plan
# Select: onboarding-ms, Bump: minor, Message: "Add feature A"
git add .
git commit -m "feat: feature A"
git push origin main

# Developer B (before PR merged)
npx nx release plan
# Select: onboarding-ms, Bump: patch, Message: "Fix bug B"
git add .
git commit -m "fix: bug B"
git push origin main

# → Version Packages PR automatically updates
# → Shows both changes
# → Final version: 1.1.0 (minor > patch)
# → CHANGELOG includes both messages
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ PR updates with each push
- ✅ Version bump follows highest bump type
- ✅ All changes listed in CHANGELOG
- ✅ All version plan files deleted on merge

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### `nx.json` - Nx Release Configuration

```json
{
  "release": {
    "versionPlans": true,
    "projects": [
      "apps/*",
      "infra/resources/dev/*",
      "infra/resources/uat/*",
      "infra/resources/prod/*"
    ],
    "changelog": {
      "projectChangelogs": {
        "createRelease": false,
        "file": "{projectRoot}/CHANGELOG.md"
      }
    },
    "git": {
      "commit": true,
      "tag": false,
      "stageChanges": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Settings**:
- `versionPlans: true`: Enable version plans feature
- `projects`: Which directories to scan for versionable projects
- `git.tag: false`: Workflows handle tagging (avoids PR branch pollution)
- `git.commit: true`: Nx commits version changes automatically

### Maven Support (Future)

For Java projects with `pom.xml`:

```bash
npm install -D @nx/maven

# Nx automatically detects pom.xml files
# Updates <version> tags alongside package.json
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Why Version Plans?

- **Identical to Changesets**: Same developer experience, native to Nx
- **No Extra Tools**: No Changesets bot or external services
- **Single Command**: `nx release` handles everything (version + changelog + commit)
- **Git-Based**: Version plans are files in the repo, trackable in PRs

### Why 3 Workflows?

1. **deploy-dev.yml**: Continuous deployment (every change)
2. **version-packages.yml**: PR automation (when version plans pushed)
3. **release.yml**: Tag creation + UAT/PROD deploy (when PR merged)

This separation keeps concerns distinct and workflows simple.

### Why `git.tag: false`?

If Nx creates tags during `nx release` in the PR workflow:
- Tags get created on a branch (not main)
- Creates confusion and clutters tag list
- Solution: Workflows create tags after merge on main
